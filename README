midisplit is a utility that splits MIDI files into tracks based on notes or
instruments.  The motivation was that software drum machines generally put 
all drums and percussion on to a single track when exporting to MIDI.  This 
prevents the drums from being individually mixed, effected, etc.  Anyway, there
are a bunch of options and ways to split or filter the MIDI file.  Check the 
man page.

To build you need a D compiler.  The makefile assumes dmd.  If you install, it 
defaults to /usr/local. Just do

make
sudo make install

The utility is standard D and should compile on Windows or OS X without problems
just by

dmd midisplit.d

I don't have access to a machine with a D compiler on either of those platforms.
